# ECE310-FA23-Practice-Demos

This repository contains helpful code demos for students to practice core course concepts. You may either run the code demos in the online Binder environment on the course website, or clone this repository and run the Jupyter notebooks locally on your own machine in your own Python environment. Below is a running list of available demos.

## Frequency response
This notebook gives an easy interface to try different choices of impulse response and plot the resulting magnitude and phase responses. This may be helpful practice to try sketching the magnitude and phase response by hand first, then verifying your plots with the provided code.
